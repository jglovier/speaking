## [Product Design and Markerboard Mentality](product-design-and-markerboard-mentality)

Markerboard mentality is all challenging people who make things to fully understand the problems we set out to solve from an objective perspective before focusing on the details of implementation. The point is to encourage software designers and developers to rethink our initial strategy for approaching the problems that we solve.

The temptation for people who build solutions (whether code based solutions or design based solutions) is to focus on the details execution and implementation first, when the best way to tackle a challenge is often from a higher, more abstract vantage point.

This talk was given at CPOSC 2013, and based on [this article](http://joelglovier.com/writing/2013/markerboard-mentality/).

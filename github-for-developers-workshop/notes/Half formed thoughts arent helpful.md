[brief: Raw ideas are good. They are the stuff that polished and successful strategies come from. But raw ideas alone aren't helpful. Some people love to come up with raw ideas and expect others to refine them, thinking they have some magical role in the process that nobody else can do, and from which all of the other magic springs forth. But it's not true. Anyone can come up with brilliant ideas. It's not ideas alone that are the source of great things. It usually starts with an idea, yes (but not always, sometimes it just happens without intention because process, momentum, and timing all coincide together), but an idea no more produces a successful business or product than the desire to move produces an olympic runner. In most cases, it is actually the work that happens after the idea for which all of the credit is truly due. It is the refining of the idea, the breaking open of the problem and crafting solutions, the strategizing of a roadmap, the building of the actual thing. An idea certainly has the power to inspire and to motivate, and for that it should not be shortchanged, but lets also not confuse motivated and inspired people with the end result of what those people do with the idea and is largely the result of the work after ideation.]

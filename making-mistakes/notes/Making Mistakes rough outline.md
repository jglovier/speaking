## Point 1: Everyone makes mistakes
	- Captain obvious slide
	- STORYTIME: messing up on stage as a kid
	- QUOTE: 
- Everybody makes mistakes
	- Examples of mistakes we make
		- Breaking things (accident gif)
		- Pushing broken code
		- Not optmizing code
		- Overwriting something that wasn't backed up
		- Deploying a breaking change
		- Not writing tests!!!
		- Reinventing the wheel
		- Scope creep
		- Missing deadlines
		- Failing to consult stakeholders
	- It might seem like some people don't make mistakes, but they do (EVERYONE does)
	- Imposter syndrome
- Nobody likes to make mistakes
	- We're trained to avoid mistakes (negative reinforcement; punative reactions)
	- Mistakes do have real consquences in the real world

## **Point 2: Mistakes aren't bad**

	- Why do we think they are bad?
		- as we already talked about they have consequences, and we're trained to avoid mistakes
	- But Making mistakes is how we learn
	- Failing helps you:
		- Identify problems
		- Learn important lessons
		- Realize you're not perfect and become more careful in the future
	- Fail fast, fail often

## **Point 3: How GitHub can help you make mistakes better**
	- Version control
	- GitHub Desktop apps 
	- Feature branching
	- Pull requests (code review and discussion)
	- Deployment
		- Automate (Hubot)
		- Branch Deploy
		- Revert!

## **Conclusion**
	- story
	- review points
		- Mistakes are good, and to be embraced
		- GitHub provides a context for embracing the power of mistakes, and freeing you to focus on building things without fear of failure

## Personal Stories

### Mistakes

**Pro skaters fail too**

How many skaters or former skaters do we have in the house? Anyone know Daewon Song? When I was younger I used to love watching skate videos and Daewon Song was one of my favorite pro skaters. That dude was one of the sickest technical skaters of his generation. I mean everything he was doing looked like the future of skateboarding.

There was the one particular video I used to watch all the time. It was called Rodney Mullen vs Daewon Song. Two of the most technical skaters at the time going head to head in one video. Here's a clip from that video from 1997.

*[play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Izkj2PNG4&t=1m37s till 2m25s]*

I don't know if you see what he's doing but he was busting fakie heelflips to manual to treflip out. I mean just mind blown! All of Daewon's tricks were so clean - it looked like he had complete control over his board and he could just never fall. 

*[play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMerNQucwvc&t=0m20s till 1m15s]*

Daewon is still skating and he's still amazing. Here's some footage from recent years. The dude is still a master.

But one of my favorite things about the skate videos was when the scenes at the end when they showed the outakes where they fall, break their board, hit their nuts on a rail, etcetera. 

Here's some of Daewon's less impressive tricks:

Turns out, to land a lot of great tricks you have to be willing bail a lot too.

And for me this was always great reminder that A) these skateboarding idols I looked up to were normal people too, and B) it turns out it takes a lot of filming failures to get the shot where you land the trick.

And this isn't just how it is in skateboarding - this is life. Life is filled with failures, but we cultivate and showcase the successes.

**Email blast fail**

One time I sent an email to all of our Enterprise customers with a broken URL. I didn't write the copy or markup of the contents myself, and I just assumed it was all ready to go so I completely failed to test links (I tested rendering in Litmus but not actual links), and I sent the email. I was super embarrarsed and had to page Ops to help me resolve the issue by some DNS settings, but not after the email had already gotten out to thousands of customers with the URL still broken. So after that I learned to always test email links for working URLs!

It weighed 24.5 pounds (12 kg), cost US$1795—just over half the cost of a computer from other manufacturers with comparable features—and ran the popular CP/M 2.2 operating system. It was designed to fit under an airline seat. Osborne and company were very successful at selling their new portable computer - at their peak selling 10,000 machines per month. However Osborne was himself no stranger to miskates. In fact, his company filed for bankruptcy after a product announcement for newer, more advanced models, canabalised sales of the existing model in production while everyone held out for the new models. In fact, this effect of a pre-announcement of a new product causing a catastrophic collapse in demand for older ones, became known as the Osborne effect.

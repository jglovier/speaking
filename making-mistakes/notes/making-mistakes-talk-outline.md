# Making Mistakes

## Intro

**About me**

I'm Joel Glovier. And I'm a designer at GitHub. I'm @jglovier on GitHub and Twitter. I'd love to hear feedback or questions later so hollar at me on Twitter if you have questions or comments. Or, find me on GitHub and fork one of my projects.

I'm from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania where I work remotely. This is a picture of me and my beloved. Her name is Ashley. What are you laughing at? OMG is that Samuel L Jackson photobombing our picture? Ha! I never even noticed that.

Ashley and I have three beautiful, precious little terrorists. Shoutout to my wife because she's at home with the terrorists while I'm here all week.

**About GitHub**

I work for GitHub where I'm part of the Creative team. At GitHub we're known for a few things. We're known for:

The Octocat. That's our nonsenical, animated mascot. Her full name is Mona Lisa Octocat.

We're known for Creating Git.

Which is totally not true. Actually Linus Torvalds created git as a utility to help manage contributions to the Linux Kernel. But lots of people still think  we created Git, so just wanted to clear that up.

We're known for our asyncronous culture. We used to say that GitHub is a fully distributed company that happens to have some physical locations where people work. That's changing a bit more and more as the company grows, but we're still very asyncronous in the way we work, in the tools we use, and how we manage projects.

In fact currently we have 50% of our 271 employees working remotely across the globe.

And we're known for open source. GitHub is the world's largest host of open source projects. Our whole platform is built around this idea of distributed collaboration, and the idea of making it better to work together than alone.

Node, Rails, jQuery, Bootstrap, Ruby and millions more projects are all hosted on GitHub. In fact some of you may have heard that a couple weeks ago Google Code announced it is shutting down and encouraging users to migrate their projects to GitHub. Even Microsoft chose GitHub when open sourcing .Net a few months ago, instead of it's own Codeplex platform.

So that's GitHub...in a nutshell.

**A quick survey**

If you'll humor me for a moment I'd like to take an informal survey. We're going to do one of those fancy live polling things, except I've come up with a great way for you to respond without having to go to some url on your phone, or text me anything. It's super high tech. All you have to do, is raise your hand.

**How many people here use GitHub?**
	- Yes - all the time
	- Yes - occasionally
	- Yes - but only to download stuff
	- No - version control is for suckers. I like to lose my work.
	- No - what's a GitHub?

**Do you use GitHub for personal or work projects?**
	- Yes - mostly work
	- Yes - mostly personal
	- Yes - both

**Have you ever used an open source project in your work?**
	- Yes - if someone else solved it already, why should I?
	- No - other peoples work can't be trusted

**Do you contribute to OS projects or maintain one?**
	- Yes - I contribute occasionally
	- Yes - I contribute often
	- Yes - I maintain an open source project
	- No - "F@#% you. Pay me."

**Have you thought of open sourcing something, but haven't yet because...?**
	- Yes - sharing my code with others is scarry
	- Yes - git/command line is a barrier
	- Yes - I'm not sure if my idea is useful for others
	- Yes - no barrier; just would rather play Destiny

I talk to people sometimes who tell me they feel intimidated by GitHub. In fact we do a lot of user research at GitHub, and this is actually a pretty common sentiment among developers, especially ones new to GitHub.

My esteemed college Chrissie Brodigan leads user research, and she's talked to lots of people who feel intimidated by GitHub. For some people it's the complexities of using Git and the command line, for others it's the fear of contributing to open source projects and the risk of having people criticize what you've made. But most of the time it's not really GitHub that intimidates them, it's the fear of making a mistake.

And that's what we're going to talk about for a little while.

**Outline**
[review outline slide]

Here's a quick outline of what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about how everybody makes mistakes, and it's a normal part of doing anything. We're going to talk about why mistakes aren't actually a bad thing. And finally, I'm going to share how GitHub can actually help you make mistakes well.

This talk is half inspirational, and half technical. The first two things we're going to talk about are going to sound a little preachy, but I want to challenge you to modify how you think about making mistakes. And the last point where we talk about GitHub as a way of mitigating the cost of mistakes is going to be a practical and technical overview of how you can go and apply this way of thinking about mistakes in your daily development grind.

## Everyone makes mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes. Thank you, Captain Obvious.

*[STORYTIME slide]*

STORYTIME: When I was a kid I was terrified of being on stage. Once, when I was in like 4th grade, somehow they talked me into singing a song all by myself as part of the school Christmas thing. (I call it a thing because I don't even remember if it was a play, or a musical, or just some type of freakish child trauma experiment. I mean that's what all that stuff is, right? They're just trying to make little kids pee their pants on stage!) 

Anyway, all I can remember is that I was supposed to sing a song in front of hundreds of people, in a dark room with a spotlight shining in my face. And I was like 10 years old! 

So I walked out on stage, and the music started, and I started singing...and suddenly I realized I was singing the complete wrong thing (I started on the second or third verse or something). So of course I just stopped, and they stopped the music and rewound the cassette tape, and started it again, and I started all over. And it was terrifying, and it pretty much scared me for life for being on a stage.

Except it didn't. Because stuff like that happens to everyone, all the time, and we get over it. It's a natural part of the process. Almost everyone experiences stagefright their first time on stage (or every time), and everyone you see on a stage who seems bold and confident knows that feeling whether they still get it or not.

(pick cool quote for here)

*[Mistakes we make slide]*

These are some really basic examples, but just so we are all on the same page that we do all make mistakes, here's a few examples of mistakes that maybe you have made before.

*[Mistake examples slides...]*

These are some great examples of mistakes we all make from time to time, and they're a simple reminder that we do all make mistakes.





**[Version control]**
*[story: talk about an experience where I made a mistake and was horrified by my mistake working with code]*
*[story: illustrate how we are trained to avoid mistakes since we are little]*
*[story: illustrate how the best work can only come from freedom to fail, and making mistakes (edison and his 1000 ways to not make a light bulb?)]*

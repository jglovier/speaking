**Pro skaters fail too**

How many skaters or former skaters do we have in the house? Anyone know Daewon Song? When I was younger I used to love watching skate videos and Daewon Song was one of my favorite pro skaters. That dude was one of the sickest technical skaters of his generation. I mean everything he was doing looked like the future of skateboarding.

There was the one particular video I used to watch all the time. It was called Rodney Mullen vs Daewon Song. Two of the most technical skaters at the time going head to head in one video. Here's a clip from that video from 1997.

I don't know if you see what he's doing but he was busting fakie heelflips to manual to treflip out. I mean just mind blown! All of Daewon's tricks were so clean - it looked like he had complete control over his board and he could just never fall.

Daewon is still skating and he's still amazing. Here's some footage from recent years. The dude is still a master.

But one of my favorite things about the skate videos was when the scenes at the end when they showed the outakes where they fall, break their board, hit their nuts on a rail, etcetera.

Here's some of Daewon's less impressive tricks:

Turns out, to land a lot of great tricks you have to be willing bail a lot too.

And for me this was always great reminder that A) these skateboarding idols I looked up to were normal people too, and B) it turns out it takes a lot of filming failures to get the shot where you land the trick.

And this isn't just how it is in skateboarding - this is life. Life is filled with failures, but we cultivate and showcase the successes.

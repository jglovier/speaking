_[slide 2: name and twitter handle]_

I'm Joel Glovier - "jglovier" on GitHub and Twitter, so if you have any questions or thoughts about the workshop after it's over, I'll be around for a little while to answer questions but feel free to ping me on Twitter and we can continue the discussion.

_[slide 3: the roadmap ]_



----
NOTES:
- need to show them visual results
- get them excited about why version control
	- starting point: ask, put your hand up if you code in HTML, PHP, PEARL, CSS, JAVA, RUBY, JAVACRIPT
	- what are you currently storing your code in? zip file? a Folder? an external hard drive? on your hosting providers server? printed it out?
	- have you ever felt nervous about making a change to your code? Like your concerned that your gonna break the whole thing if you change something? Or what if you want to experiment with changing a feature, but your afraid if it doesn't work, then how are you gonna get back to where you were before? 
	- The very best designers and programmers are experimenters. The best developers out there don't just get it right on the first try, they iterate. Great code, great software, great products don't just happen, they are the product of trying things, and trying things, and trying things over and over and over.
	- what I want to give you is a way to freely experiment in an environment without the risk of losing anything, or breaking anything, or having to redo what you already had. It's called version control.
	- version control is like having a map of where you are going and where you have been. It gives you the ability to explore a new route to somewhere without getting lost.
	- who has ever had to write a paper for school? Has anyone ever had the experience of losing your work only to have to retype the whole paper again?
	- who has used a version control system before? who has used SVN? Who has used Trac? Who has used Git?

- write the 3 or 4 big points on a markerboard if possible

- try getting them to fork a sample project from me
- avoid the command line and stick with GUIs

- Outline
- Why is version control important
- Reasons to use Git: Distributed, cheap branches, merging is easy, GitHub
- GitHub Desktop Clients
- 3 stage thinking (working directory, staging, and history)
- Commit in logical chunks
- Use branches for features / bugfixes
- Merging & resolving conflicts
- Pull Requests

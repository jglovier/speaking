## POINT: Designing and building software is a creative exercise
### Subpoint:
**Illustration:**
Microsoft vs. Apple: Both companies make good products. But in a very general sense in their respective histories, Microsoft has tended to focus on quantity, while Apple has focused on quality. And to be fair it was probably just a natural outcome of their respective market shares. 

For years Microsoft held more than 90% of the PC market, while Apple ran their business on less than 10% of the total PC market. Of course Microsoft focused on quantity, because that was their competitive advantage - almost everyone used their products!

And of course Apple focused on quality, because when you have a tiny slice of the pie your pie better be the best tasting pie around!

But fast forward to today and by focusing on building only the highest quality software and hardware, Apple has managed to become the wealthiest company in the world with more than 11 billion dollars in the bank and a 450 billion dollar market cap. Compare that with Microsoft who has less than 4 billion in the bank and a 288 billion dollar market cap. [Numbers from Wolfram Alpha on Oct 15, 2013]

In fact, according to one report, Microsoft's market share has fallen from 90% to about 33% in the past 5 years. There's lots of factors for this including Apple's dominance in the tablet space, but the fact that Apple has built their business on quality over quantity is certainly something to take note of.

## The Problem

1. **We don't want to talk about it, we just want to do it.** 
We don't want to talk about it, we just to build it. We're hackers - we throw stuff together and get it done. Don't waste time talking about it, spend time doing it. That's our MO.

And while it's great to be focused on shipping things, the temptation is for us to look at **planning** & spending time on **strategy** as a waste of time that could be spent building.

The way we build software at GitHub is to build the minimum viable product, ship it with the least amount of features necessary for it to work, and then continuously iterate from that platform. Lots of people build software this way. It's an excellent way to build great products.

But it is primarily a strategy for building products, not designing them. And great products must be both designed **and** built.

One of the temptations within this type of lean development workflow is to punt when we get to the design and planning phase, thinking that if iteration is the goal we can simply plan spontaneously as we go. Which can work but it's a false premise. Iteration isn't the goal, building great products is. Iteration is just a part of how we reach that goal, and so is design.

2. **Culture has trained us to think quantity over quality, but in software design quality trumps quantity**
We are wired by culture for efficiency. Where does that come from? It's a remnant of the Industrial Revolution and the manufacturing industry that still exists today. In the production of goods, the more items you make, the more items you sell and the more profit you get. The axiom of the industrial economy is "the greater the quantity of your production, the more successful you are."

While efficiency certainly has its virtues in a post-industrial revolution age of information, it is not the highest goal or the virtue to which all others are subservient. Efficiency is important but optimizing for efficiency in software design is missing the point of the work.

What's more important in software production than quantity is quality because the quality of the software is what is going to determine whether people want to use it, and what their experience is like when they do. The cost of production for software in a distribution sense is a non-factor since digital assets can be reproduced at low/no cost. So optimizing for quantity is really holding to a mindset that has it's roots in a time where your primary goal was to produce and distribute as much of the product as possible, not design the most desirable product possible.

3. **We often to think mostly about solutions to specific problems instead of dwelling on the bigger picture**
As engineers and solutions minded people, it's natural for us to assemble collections of solutions in our heads. We love to think about implementation. That's what engineers do.

And for the record, great engineers and great creatives are basically the same. Great engineers employ creativity to solve problems, and great creatives engineer solutions that just tend to have a visual bend. That's why when I talk about software design today, I'm really talking about something much bigger than interface design, web design or graphic design. I'm actually not really even talking about visual design at all. I'm talking about conceptual design. Crafting a plan for how to solve the problem that needs solved. That's what software design is all about, because that's what software is all about: solving problems.

So we love to think about solutions at a micro level. That's how  we get things done! We break problems and solutions down into tasks to be accomplished. Just look at all the agile workflow tools out there: Trello, Pivitol Tracker, Jira, Kanban, AgileZen - they are all optimized for a task based workflow. Which is great for the actual development process, but when we apply those habits to the product design process we tend to get so focused on specific steps that we miss out on the **big picture**, the macro level view that we have to step back and look through from time to time if we are truly going to build things that solve peoples problems and make people want to use them.

# Cultivating Positive User Experiences

What determines whether a user has a positive experience or a negative experience? How do we cultivate positive user experience? Are there things we can do as product designers to make sure a users experience is positive? What pitfalls do we often fall into that can lead to a negative user experience?

We will explore these questions and look at why cultivating positive user experiences is about a relationship with the audience of your product, and why empathy is a critical lens to  wear when designing for that relationship.

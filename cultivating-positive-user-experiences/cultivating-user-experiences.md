# Cultivating Positive User Experiences

## Defining User Experience

What is "User Experience"? Of course, when we say "User Experience Design" or "UX", we are referring to a subcategory of the software or web industry that deals specifically with examining the users of our products, and particularly how they respond to said products.

Sometimes we are referring to the strategic planning phase of a product where we consider how we should accommodate users through our application. Other times we are referring to a specific practice called "user testing", where users of a product are observed in action engaging with the product in order to uncover hidden pain points, or brainstorm for new features. 

And then, there is a general use of the term "user experience" that is more of a categorical label for the mantra of serving and considering users first when creating a piece of software. This last one is a little different in that it is more of an ideology or philosophy than a discipline. It's an ideology that can drive execution of user testing, or user experience planning, but itself encompasses a much broader scope than any specific practice of itself will.

That all sounds really philosphical, but at base level all work in the field of User Experience really just deals with relationships - specifically, the relationship of a product we create to the users who it is intended to serve. How users actually engage with that product, what is difficult for them in using the product, and how it can be optimized for a better experience for the end user.

The interesting thing about this field is that it contains both subjective elements and empirical elements, depending on how it is approached. For example, part of understanding a user experience, or setting UX goals, typically involve emotive responses by the user, like, "did the user become frustrated in using the product?", or "did the user feel satisfied in being able to accomplish their objectives?" 

But at the same time we can also approach from a more empirical perspective by giving objective, quantitative goals to the approach that can be measured with statements like, "Did the user accomplish the objective?", or "How many of the described tasks was the user able to complete?"

So in this sense, user experience design it is both a discipline of objective outcomes, and subjective emotional responses. It lies somewhere in that magical space between exact science and art form.

## What Is A Successful/Positive User Experience?

A successful user experience is when a user feels delighted by their experience (or at the very least *not* annoyed) and is able to effectively accomplish what they set out to use the application to do, whether their goal was intentional or not.

1. emotive response
2. enabling accomplishment of tasks

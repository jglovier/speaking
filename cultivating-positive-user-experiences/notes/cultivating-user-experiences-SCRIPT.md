# Cultivating Positive User Experiences

**Intro** - who I am…

**Experiences define how we think of and feel toward things. Everything.**

**(Personal Story)**
- Terrific User Experience - talk about being in San Francisco recently and using Uber to get around…
- Terrible User Experience - talk about my Harrisburg City Cap experiences recently going to the airport for Front End…

*I love Uber. I hate Harrisburg City Cabs. Why?
*The difference in these two stories - and consequently how I feel about the two products (Uber vs Harrisburg City Cabs) is the experience I had with them.

## What is User Experience Design?

**User Experience**

A *"user experience"* is what it's like for someone to use the tool you've given them (software, website, etc) to accomplish the thing they are trying to do with you tool.

**User Experience Design**

As a discipline in the field of software and products, *user experience design* refers to the study, observation, and optimization of that process by which someone uses the tools we make for them.

1. Study => means it's intentional. It's not arbitrary, we do this through research, trial and error, learning and practicing.
2. Observation => means it's not hypothetical, it's practical and based on testing actual users. 
3. Optimization => means it's purpose driven with a goal of improving the experience. It's not something we do just because.

[Joel Glovier | @jglovier Slide]()

Hi, I'm Joel Glovier. (My twitter handle is @jglovier in case you want to ping me later and chat more) 

I work for a wonderful company called GitHub. We make tools to help people work together. I'm part of the training team where I do UX and Product Design for top secret projects that I'm not going to talk about here today.

But what I am going to talk about is "Cultivating Positive User Experiences"

[Title Slide Duplicate]

Two Stories:
A Positive User Experience: Uber
A Negative User Experience: Harrisburg City Cabs

So as you might tell, I'm a big Uber fan. And as for Harrisburg City Cabs…not so much. What's the difference? It's the experience I had with each.

["Experiences affect how we view everything in life." quote slide]

["Table of Contents slide"]

So here's what we going to talk about over the next few minutes. First I want to talk about understanding what user experience means to our industry. Then we're gonna look at some of the benefits of practicing good user experience design. And finally we'll talk about how to practices a UX driven approach to software design and development.

["What Is User Experience?" section title slide]

So what is "user experience" anyway? What do we mean when we talk about user experience? Is it designing layouts for our websites? Is it something more abstract like planning out the user workflow of our product? Or is something even more ethereal like a philosophy on how approach software in general?

Yes. The fact is "user experience" is a really broad term that we use to refer to a lot of different things.

["UX in a General Sense" slide]

In a general sense, a *"user experience"* is just what it's like for someone to use the tool you've given them to accomplish the thing they are trying to do with your tool.
